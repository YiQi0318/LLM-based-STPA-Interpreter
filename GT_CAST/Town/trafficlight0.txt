CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Increased risk of signal misinterpretation or control delay due to snowy conditions, poor contrast, and limited lane visibility in a residential zone.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Ensure traction and visible lane delineation.
Contribution:
- Road surface is fully covered with snow, eliminating standard lane boundaries.
- No evidence of plowing or sanding.
- Likely reduction in grip and increased braking distance.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Provide clear navigational and regulatory cues.
Contribution:
- Yellow centerline faintly visible; edge and crosswalk markings absent.
- Traffic signal present but small and partially washed out by overcast conditions.
- No additional signage visible to reinforce traffic rules.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Interpret environment and support driving control.
Contribution:
- Vision-based systems may struggle to detect signal and road edges.
- Lack of lane markings may disable or impair lane-keeping assistance.
- Perception systems must rely heavily on GPS or other fallback methods.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Maintain road readiness and signal clarity.
Contribution:
- Signal placement is minimally visible and lacks prominence in snow/fog.
- No physical or digital snow hazard mitigation evident.
- Poor maintenance reduces both human and machine confidence in the environment.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Observe, interpret, and act on environmental signals.
Contribution:
- Drivers may miss the traffic signal due to visual blending with background.
- Lane position uncertainty may lead to drift or misalignment.
- Reduced surface feedback adds to reaction time and decision uncertainty.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide proactive hazard awareness and environmental context.
Contribution:
- No alerts present for snowy road conditions or visibility limitations.
- System provides no dynamic updates or speed guidance.
- Weather-aware infrastructure appears absent.

Summary:
This residential snow scene presents a deceptively simple but risky environment. Poor lane visibility, weak signal contrast, and a lack of responsive infrastructure raise challenges for both driver judgment and autonomous systems, particularly in interpreting right-of-way and maintaining control.
