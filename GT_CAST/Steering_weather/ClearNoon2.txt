CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Minimal risk of lane interpretation error due to weak contrast from sun glare and moderate fading of road markings under bright noon conditions.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide physical consistency and traction.
Contribution:
- Surface appears clean, dry, and structurally intact.
- Bright sunlight highlights slight surface texture variations.
- No defects or pooling observed, though glare is noticeable.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Define lane paths and spatial awareness.
Contribution:
- Lane markings are present but moderately faded.
- High ambient light reduces their contrast against the asphalt.
- No use of reflectivity or adaptive visual enhancement for high glare.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Detect lanes and support automated control.
Contribution:
- Vision-based systems may experience minor contrast-related detection dropouts.
- Lane assist features likely functional but operating with low confidence margins.
- Sudden exposure to bright light zones may reduce visual continuity.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Ensure visual safety and infrastructure readiness.
Contribution:
- Markings show signs of wear and reduced reflectivity.
- No compensatory treatments (e.g., reflective paint or embossed lines).
- Design does not appear tailored for optimal performance in bright daylight.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Interpret visual feedback and manage vehicle control.
Contribution:
- Faded lines may blend into the pavement under glare.
- Potential for delayed or ambiguous lane decisions.
- Driver effort slightly increased to interpret lane layout clearly.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide hazard alerts related to environmental conditions.
Contribution:
- No signage or visual warnings addressing glare or visual noise.
- System lacks environmental context integration for visibility challenges.
- No mitigation messaging for high-brightness driving periods.

Summary:
This bright noon driving scenario presents a mostly safe surface with moderate visual drawbacks. Faded markings and intense lighting may slightly reduce both human and system-based lane interpretation, increasing the chance of transient alignment imprecision without posing high risk.
