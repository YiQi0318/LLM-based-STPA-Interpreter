CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Visual confusion or failure to respond to traffic control due to backlighting, low-contrast snow surface, and poor visibility of the signal.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide safe traction and lane visibility.
Contribution:
- Entire road is snow-covered, obscuring lane lines and curb boundaries.
- No tire tracks or texture cues to aid lane estimation.
- Flat and featureless snow blanket may reduce driver or system confidence.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Inform and organize traffic flow visually.
Contribution:
- Faint yellow centerline visible, but no side or intersection markings.
- Traffic signal is active, but washed out due to direct sunlight and glare.
- No supplementary signage or surface arrows to assist positioning.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Detect lane, signs, signals, and obstacles.
Contribution:
- Vision-based lane tracking likely ineffective due to snow cover.
- Sun glare may interfere with camera detection of signal state.
- LIDAR and radar may compensate, but visual cues are mostly absent.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Support safe road use through infrastructure design and upkeep.
Contribution:
- No visible snow removal effort.
- Signal placement does not account for glare or sun angle.
- Lacks reinforcement measures such as reflective signposts or shaded signal hoods.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Observe and react to roadway and traffic signals.
Contribution:
- Low visibility of the signal due to sun glare may delay driver reaction.
- Minimal surface cues cause potential uncertainty about intersection limits.
- Increased chance of abrupt stopping, missed signal, or unintended movement.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Inform users of visibility or traction hazards.
Contribution:
- No dynamic alerts for reduced visibility or signal interference.
- System does not adapt or notify based on sun angle or snow presence.
- Absence of environmental feedback to improve situational awareness.

Summary:
This snow-covered street with a sun-facing traffic light presents a visually degraded scene. Poor signal visibility, low-contrast ground, and absent cues challenge both manual and automated systems. This intersection carries elevated perceptual risk despite structurally low traffic complexity.
