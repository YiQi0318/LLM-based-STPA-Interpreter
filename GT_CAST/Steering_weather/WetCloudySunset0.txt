CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Vehicle control risk or misjudgment due to widespread water accumulation and reduced marking visibility.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Structural integrity and water management of road.
Contribution:
- Extensive water patches indicate very poor drainage.
- Uneven texture or wear may increase slipping hazard.
- Inadequate maintenance for weather resilience.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Visual lane definition.
Contribution:
- Markings are partially submerged and degraded.
- Low contrast with road surface in wet conditions.
- No indicators to alert drivers to faded or submerged markings.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Functional safety mechanisms.
Contribution:
- Traction loss likely in hydroplaning conditions.
- Lane assistance may malfunction without visible lane inputs.
- Braking systems may not fully compensate under wet impact.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Oversight and preventive action.
Contribution:
- Ineffective water drainage design or response.
- Missing temporary warnings for slick or pooled areas.
- Lack of proactive maintenance leads to long-term hazard buildup.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Response to perceived and actual road conditions.
Contribution:
- Vision-based misinterpretation of lane alignment.
- Overcorrection or hesitance in maneuvering.
- Assumes infrastructure will provide sufficient feedback.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Risk communication.
Contribution:
- No localized alerts about surface pooling or poor visibility.
- No dynamic signage or adjustments observed.

Summary:
High water coverage and degraded visual cues create system-wide risk across physical, technical, and human layers. The absence of adaptive signaling and poor infrastructure resilience exacerbate the hazard.
