CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Elevated risk of lane deviation or traction loss due to moderate rainfall, water patches, and weak lane marking visibility.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide a consistent, high-friction travel surface.
Contribution:
- Surface exhibits moderate rain coverage with several water patches.
- Some uneven areas where water collects suggest drainage inefficiency.
- Risk of hydroplaning increases in pooled sections.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Offer visual cues for navigation and lane guidance.
Contribution:
- Lane lines are faint and partially obscured by water glare.
- Markings lack reflectivity or rain-adaptive materials.
- Visual clarity is significantly reduced, especially in wet areas.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Maintain control and assist with perception and response.
Contribution:
- Lane assist and vision-based systems may fail or disengage intermittently.
- ABS or traction control may be activated in response to loss of grip.
- Cameras may misinterpret reflections or fail to detect lane lines.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Maintain road safety infrastructure and respond to weather hazards.
Contribution:
- No proactive mitigation (e.g., improved drainage, reflective markings).
- Absence of real-time alerts or visual warnings for wet zones.
- Deferred surface maintenance contributes to hazard amplification.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Interpret environment and operate vehicle under uncertainty.
Contribution:
- Likely to misjudge lane positions due to blurred visuals.
- Wet conditions increase the chance of delayed or abrupt corrections.
- Reduced trust in infrastructure cues can elevate decision-making stress.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide hazard alerts based on environmental changes.
Contribution:
- No evidence of real-time warnings or rain condition notifications.
- Drivers remain uninformed of localized wet surface risks.
- Lack of adaptive signage or condition-responsive feedback systems.

Summary:
This scenario presents a compromised driving environment where rain-induced water accumulation and degraded lane visibility jointly impair both driver and vehicle system performance. Without sufficient infrastructure support or alerts, the risk of instability and misalignment increases substantially.
