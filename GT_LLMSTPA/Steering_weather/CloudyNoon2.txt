Control Action (CA):
The automotive vehicle is steering.

Scene Description:
- Weather: Dry and overcast — **no precipitation or water presence**, but cloud cover diffuses sunlight.
- Time: Noon or early afternoon; **even ambient lighting** with minimal shadows or glare.
- Road: Multi-lane highway on a curve; **lane markings are clear and visible** with no apparent surface occlusion.
- Environment Complexity: Low — empty scene with no dynamic elements; consistent edge barriers are present.
- Sensor Visibility Risk: Low — although contrast is slightly reduced, **no glare, puddles, or harsh shadows** are present to affect vision systems significantly.

Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs):
- UCA1.1: AV misinterprets surface texture or road wear as lane boundaries. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.2: AV hesitates due to low-contrast or low-variation road surface under diffused light. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.3: AV steers prematurely based on weak visual features (e.g., faded markings). [H1, H2]
- UCA1.4: AV delays steering unnecessarily to validate already-visible markings. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.5: AV continues steering longer than needed due to minimal feedback variation. [H1, H3]
- UCA2.1: AV terminates maneuver before actual alignment is verified. [H2, H3]

Loss Scenario Log:
- t0: UCA1.1, UCA1.3 → AV triggers steering in response to non-lane surface features caused by low-contrast ambient lighting.
- t1: UCA1.5 → Prolonged correction results from insufficient variation in lateral feedback cues.
- t2: UCA2.1 → AV stops correction based on a false assumption of lane alignment under uniform lighting.

Causality:
- t0: Cloudy lighting reduces contrast between lane markings and road surface.
- t1: Poor feature distinction slows or misguides the correction loop.
- t2: Termination of maneuver occurs without clear sensory validation.

Final Loss: AV risks slight lateral drift or oscillation within the lane due to misinterpretation of surface features under flat-light conditions.

Safe Scenario Log (Mitigated):
- t0: AV confirms lane edges using cross-validated camera and map-based cues.
- t1: Correction behavior is optimized for low-gradient scenes using high-confidence tracking.
- t2: Correction ends only after full confirmation from inertial and visual feedback fusion.

Final Safe Outcome: AV maintains stable and accurate trajectory during cloudy noon conditions by relying on validated perception rather than contrast-dependent features.
