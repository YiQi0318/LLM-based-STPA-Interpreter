Control Action (CA):
The automotive vehicle is steering.

Scene Description:
- Weather: Clear and dry; road surface and visibility are ideal.
- Time: Daytime — consistent sunlight with moderate shadows.
- Road: Two-lane urban street with **oncoming traffic (van)**, **stationary car ahead in same lane**, **motorbike in the distance**, and **tight curbside spacing**.
- Environment Complexity: High — involves **moving and static vehicles**, **narrow lane**, **urban buildings**, and **pedestrian features (hydrant, sidewalk)**.
- Sensor Visibility Risk: High — **partial occlusion from parked and moving vehicles**, **tree shadows**, and **small motorbike in distance** create tracking and decision timing challenges.

Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs):
- UCA1.1: AV initiates steering too early to avoid the stationary car without considering oncoming van and motorbike trajectory. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.2: AV fails to steer or delays due to uncertainty in gap estimation between obstacles. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.3: AV aggressively maneuvers without full clearance or speed profile prediction for the motorbike. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.4: AV hesitates too long, resulting in traffic blockage or near-collision with rear-following vehicles. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.5: AV sustains steering action too long, entering the oncoming lane even after hazard is cleared. [H1, H3]
- UCA2.1: AV exits the steering maneuver too early, remaining improperly aligned relative to the curb or motorbike. [H2, H3]

Loss Scenario Log:
- t0: UCA1.1 → AV initiates path change into oncoming lane to bypass car, misjudging the van’s proximity.
- t1: UCA1.5 → Correction overshoots, risking prolonged lane invasion or sidewalk proximity.
- t2: UCA2.1 → Steering ends before full lateral alignment, placing AV close to parked car or dynamic traffic.

Causality:
- t0: Poor spatial estimation under vehicle occlusion leads to premature maneuvering.
- t1: Steering response lacks refinement under multi-agent constraint.
- t2: Perceived correction completion occurs too early under spatial ambiguity.

Final Loss: AV may enter the oncoming lane unsafely, or scrape against the parked vehicle due to improper correction timing in a highly constrained, multi-agent scene.

Safe Scenario Log (Mitigated):
- t0: AV defers lateral maneuver until both lanes are monitored and spacing with van/motorbike is confirmed.
- t1: Steering is applied gradually, with collision-free corridor validation.
- t2: Final alignment is completed only after full lane return is confirmed and no obstacles remain.

Final Safe Outcome: The AV successfully steers around complex obstacles while avoiding collisions, overcorrection, or premature return to lane in a tight, multi-vehicle urban road scenario.
