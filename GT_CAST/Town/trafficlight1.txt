CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Risk of delayed or incorrect decision-making at an intersection due to snow-covered pavement, yellow signal ambiguity, and limited environmental feedback.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide traction and surface clarity for safe navigation.
Contribution:
- Snow completely covers the road surface, eliminating all lane markings.
- No visible treatment (plowing, salting) to enhance traction or visibility.
- Intersection shape is unclear due to uniform snow coverage.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Provide visual cues for lane structure and intersection behavior.
Contribution:
- Painted lines are mostly obscured by snow, except for a faint yellow line.
- No stop line or directional arrows visible at the intersection.
- Signage is minimal; traffic signal is the only active control.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Interpret road geometry, signals, and surface conditions.
Contribution:
- Lane detection systems likely impaired or inoperative.
- Camera-based signal detection may struggle with visual clarity of yellow light and bright background.
- No visible curb or boundary markings to assist lateral positioning.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Ensure visibility and safety under environmental conditions.
Contribution:
- No snow mitigation infrastructure evident.
- Traffic signal is functional, but lacks visual reinforcement (e.g., vertical reflective backing).
- No adaptive response to snow, signal timing, or reduced visibility.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Make timely decisions based on visual inputs and environment.
Contribution:
- Yellow light requires immediate decision under uncertain surface conditions.
- Snow reduces perception of safe braking distance and turning zones.
- Lack of markings and strong visual context may lead to hesitation or error.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide context-aware feedback on hazards and visibility.
Contribution:
- No warning systems for snow or signal visibility impairment.
- No advisory speed reduction or surface condition alerts.
- Environmental support system appears inactive.

Summary:
This intersection scenario poses moderate-to-high risk due to ambiguous visual cues, snow-covered surfaces, and a yellow signal that demands immediate judgment. Both human and automated systems may experience degraded decision reliability without compensatory infrastructure or alert mechanisms.
