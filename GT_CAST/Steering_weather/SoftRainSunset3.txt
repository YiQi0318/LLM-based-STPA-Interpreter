CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Potential for vehicle control error or near-miss due to widespread water accumulation and obscured lane boundaries.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Ensures surface safety and drainage.
Contribution:
- Significant water pooling is present across multiple lanes.
- Poor drainage or surface grading likely contributes to retention.
- Surface texture may be insufficient for wet grip or skid resistance.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Lane guidance and spatial orientation.
Contribution:
- Markings are submerged or washed out in many areas.
- Line clarity is inconsistent, especially in central lanes.
- No visual aids like reflectors or anti-glare paint are visible.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Supports driver and safety automation.
Contribution:
- Lane assist and vision-based guidance systems may be disabled.
- Wet surface reduces braking efficiency and stability.
- Sensor interpretation is degraded due to visual ambiguity.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Maintain infrastructure and support safe driving.
Contribution:
- No visible mitigation for known hydroplaning-prone areas.
- Reactive rather than proactive marking and drainage policy evident.
- No temporary alert mechanisms (e.g., signage, cones) in use.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Interpret road conditions and react accordingly.
Contribution:
- May misjudge lane paths or overreact to unclear visuals.
- Higher likelihood of lateral drift, especially during lane changes.
- Reliance on degraded infrastructure increases cognitive load.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Hazard communication to road users.
Contribution:
- No active signage or alerts warning of road surface wetness.
- Lacking integration with current road condition telemetry.
- Missed opportunity for preventive behavioral adaptation.

Summary:
The scene illustrates a highly degraded driving environment under wet conditions. Faded or submerged markings and poor water management present challenges to both manual and autonomous operation, increasing the risk of deviation or incident.
