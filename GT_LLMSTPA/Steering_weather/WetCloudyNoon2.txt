Control Action (CA):
The automotive vehicle is steering.

Scene Description:
- Weather: Wet road with widespread surface moisture and **multiple large puddles** scattered across lanes.
- Time: Cloudy late afternoon or early evening; **soft ambient light** with reduced contrast.
- Road: Multi-lane highway with a gradual curve; **lane markings are intermittently obscured** by standing water.
- Environment Complexity: Low — no moving objects, straight barriers on both sides.
- Sensor Visibility Risk: High — **puddle reflections and dark wet patches** create inconsistent and misleading lane visibility, posing challenges for visual interpretation.

Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs):
- UCA1.1: AV misreads water patches or reflections as lane markers or boundaries. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.2: AV fails to steer due to absence or ambiguity of visible lane lines. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.3: AV initiates steering prematurely based on false lane features. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.4: AV delays steering due to poor surface clarity. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.5: AV overcompensates by steering too long, drifting across lane boundaries. [H1, H3]
- UCA2.1: AV halts steering too early, leaving it uncentered or improperly aligned. [H2, H3]

Loss Scenario Log:
- t0: UCA1.1, UCA1.3 → Steering triggered early based on misperceived lane edges created by puddle boundaries.
- t1: UCA1.5 → Steering over-extended, resulting in lateral drift away from the correct lane path.
- t2: UCA2.1 → Steering terminates before visual confirmation of lane centering, causing misalignment.

Causality:
- t0: Poor visual conditions mislead initial maneuver.
- t1: Lack of reliable lane visibility prevents effective correction.
- t2: False positive lane detection ends correction phase too early.

Final Loss: AV operates with an unstable trajectory or misaligned position, potentially drifting into adjacent lanes or remaining off-center.

Safe Scenario Log (Mitigated):
- t0: Steering delayed until multi-sensor lane confidence reaches acceptable threshold.
- t1: Controlled, incremental steering adjustments accommodate wet surface variability.
- t2: Final correction sustained until clear confirmation of lane centering is achieved.

Final Safe Outcome: The AV safely navigates the wet and reflective roadway by applying conservative, validated steering behavior, maintaining compliance with lane integrity.
