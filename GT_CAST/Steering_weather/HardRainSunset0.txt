CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Increased likelihood of hydroplaning or misjudged lane position due to pooled water and reduced lane marking visibility during moderate rain.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide stable and drainable driving conditions.
Contribution:
- Surface exhibits multiple visible water pools.
- Texture and slope suggest inadequate drainage in several areas.
- Wet surface reduces friction and increases risk of skidding or loss of control.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Visually delineate lanes and aid navigation.
Contribution:
- Lane markings are faded and partially hidden by water accumulation.
- Reflections and glare reduce visual contrast.
- Markings are not optimized for wet visibility (e.g., no reflectivity or raised markings).

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Assist with environmental perception and operational stability.
Contribution:
- Lane keeping and vision-based systems may fail or become unreliable.
- Braking and steering responses may be delayed in slick zones.
- Hydroplaning or traction loss more likely under these wet conditions.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Maintain road safety, signage, and structural readiness.
Contribution:
- No active signage or visual indicators warning about wet conditions.
- Markings have not been adequately maintained or updated for weather resilience.
- Drainage improvements and temporary hazard controls appear absent.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Interpret environmental cues and operate vehicle.
Contribution:
- May misjudge lane center or adjacent vehicle distance.
- Stress or delayed decisions may arise from unclear markings and water.
- Behavior influenced by visual uncertainty and low road feedback.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Deliver warnings and environmental risk updates.
Contribution:
- No alerts or signage to inform drivers of slippery or flooded zones.
- Lack of real-time hazard messaging leaves drivers unprepared.
- System appears disconnected from on-road weather impact monitoring.

Summary:
This image reflects a moderate to high-risk roadway scenario due to visible water pooling and degraded visual guidance. The absence of dynamic warnings and substandard infrastructure resilience undermine safety for both manual and autonomous vehicle systems.
