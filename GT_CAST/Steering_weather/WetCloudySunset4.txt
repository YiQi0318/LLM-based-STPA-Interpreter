CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Critical risk of hydroplaning or unsafe maneuvering due to near-complete road surface saturation and indistinct lane boundaries.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Supports friction, visibility, and flow.
Contribution:
- Water fully envelops many sections, greatly reducing tire grip.
- Pavement condition suggests insufficient weather readiness.
- Water pooling not addressed in engineering or repair.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Provide structure in navigation.
Contribution:
- Lane lines nearly invisible under glare and water.
- No contrast-enhanced or reflective features implemented.
- Guidance disappears in worst-case areas.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Safeguard driving operations.
Contribution:
- Lane following algorithms may disengage or err.
- Human drivers and systems both lose path reference.
- Hydroplaning threshold reached faster due to saturation.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Oversight and readiness.
Contribution:
- Lack of mitigation or alert response.
- Persistent issues reflect backlog or misprioritization.
- Road unfit for normal operation under moderate rain.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Interpret and respond to current road state.
Contribution:
- Visibility of lane paths nearly eliminated.
- May rely on erroneous guesswork for positioning.
- Increased chance of overcorrection or unintended exit.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Translate weather into actionable risk data.
Contribution:
- No signs or digital messages indicating danger.
- Lack of alert infrastructure integration.

Summary:
This is a highly dangerous scenario where road surface saturation and visual degradation coincide to erase operational clarity. Both driver and vehicle systems are left without viable guidance or warning, constituting a systemic breakdown.
