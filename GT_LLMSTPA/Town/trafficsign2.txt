Control Action (CA):
The automotive vehicle is steering.

Scene Description:
- Weather: Moderate rain; **wet surface with visible puddles and reflective patches**, consistent with ongoing or recent rainfall.
- Time: Sunset or late afternoon; **diffused lighting** with some surface glare and soft shadows.
- Road: Multi-lane highway on a curve; **lane markings are partially visible**, but distorted by water and reflection.
- Environment Complexity: Low — no dynamic obstacles, traffic, or signage; barriers flank both sides.
- Sensor Visibility Risk: High — **glare, puddle distortion, and patchy reflections** significantly degrade camera-based lane detection reliability.

Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs):
- UCA1.1: AV misidentifies glare or puddle edges as lane markings. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.2: AV fails to steer due to low lane confidence in reflective surface zones. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.3: AV initiates steering early due to surface irregularities misclassified as lane cues. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.4: AV waits too long to steer, hoping for clearer data. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.5: Steering continues too long due to feedback delay from wet reflections. [H1, H3]
- UCA2.1: Steering ends before full centering is visually confirmed. [H2, H3]

Loss Scenario Log:
- t0: UCA1.1, UCA1.3 → AV triggers premature steering due to confusing water reflections.
- t1: UCA1.5 → Lane correction is held longer than needed, leading to lateral drift.
- t2: UCA2.1 → AV finishes maneuver without proper visual confirmation of lane center.

Causality:
- t0: AV initiates maneuver based on misinterpreted puddle edge as lane line.
- t1: Poor feedback in wet zones prolongs correction beyond target.
- t2: AV believes it is aligned and terminates steering early.

Final Loss: Vehicle may deviate from the correct trajectory or exhibit instability due to early reaction to distorted visuals and overconfidence in final positioning.

Safe Scenario Log (Mitigated):
- t0: AV waits for high-confidence lane line detection using multi-modal fusion before reacting.
- t1: Steering correction is smooth, bounded, and validated in real time.
- t2: Final maneuver ends only after clear lane centering is confirmed.

Final Safe Outcome: AV maintains safe, accurate lane position despite moderate rain and visual distortion through filtered, confirmed perception and controlled steering.
