CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Increased likelihood of misaligned driving or lane departure due to faded markings and minor water presence on a wet road.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Structural base for vehicular travel.
Contribution:
- Minor surface water remains in multiple spots.
- Possible worn or uneven areas visible.
- Maintenance does not appear to address standing water or texture consistency.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Lane visibility and spatial orientation.
Contribution:
- Markings are present but faded and intermittently clear.
- Reduced visibility could impair driver judgment and vehicle sensor interpretation.
- No enhancements such as reflective coating are evident.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Systems that respond to environmental input.
Contribution:
- Automated lane detection systems may struggle with visibility gaps.
- Tire and brake performance could be compromised by uneven grip zones.
- Systems dependent on line clarity are vulnerable to intermittent markings.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Governs road condition, maintenance, and safety protocols.
Contribution:
- Lane repainting seems overdue.
- No temporary signs or visual warnings for surface hazards or wear.
- Infrastructure oversight appears delayed or lacking in preventive updates.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Decision-makers and manual controllers in the system.
Contribution:
- May struggle to follow lanes precisely due to partial marking cues.
- Can misjudge spacing or veer when transitioning between visible and faded zones.
- Unclear visual cues may delay reaction time or provoke unsafe corrections.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Communicate environmental risks to users.
Contribution:
- No visible system communicating localized wet surface warnings.
- Missed opportunity to inform or adjust behavior based on surface status.
- Static signage appears absent.

Summary:
This scenario illustrates a partial but meaningful system breakdown. While not heavily saturated, the road suffers from deteriorating visual clarity and minor environmental hazards, impacting both automated vehicle functions and human situational awareness.
