CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: High potential for lane departure or vehicle instability due to heavy rainfall, low traction, and low lane visibility.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Support vehicle stability and facilitate water runoff.
Contribution:
- Surface is uniformly saturated from heavy rain.
- Slight reflection indicates water buildup across the lane area.
- Drainage may be insufficient for extreme rainfall rates.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Provide lane demarcation and navigation assistance.
Contribution:
- Lane markings are barely distinguishable in wet conditions.
- No reflective or textured paint evident for enhanced visibility.
- Visual guidance is compromised under rain and glare.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Provide environmental interpretation and motion control.
Contribution:
- Lane detection and vision-based controls likely degraded or disabled.
- Increased braking distance and instability expected due to low grip.
- Automated features may disengage or yield incorrect assumptions.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Maintain road safety under weather impact.
Contribution:
- No signs of weather-adaptive infrastructure (grooved pavement, signage).
- Markings have not been maintained to support adverse weather conditions.
- Lack of temporary mitigation or alert systems for current road state.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Process environmental input and control vehicle behavior.
Contribution:
- Visual field compromised by rain and faded lines.
- Driver may struggle with lane placement and distance judgment.
- High stress and potential for overcorrection or delayed reaction.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Deliver warnings and adaptive alerts.
Contribution:
- No visible alerting system for severe weather conditions.
- System does not appear integrated with current road-state sensing.
- Lacks capacity to inform or adjust driver expectations during rain.

Summary:
This heavy rain scenario reflects a severe systemic vulnerability. The combination of worn markings, pooled water, and lack of infrastructure response impairs both manual and automated driving. Without mitigation, it poses a substantial hazard for maintaining vehicle alignment and control.
