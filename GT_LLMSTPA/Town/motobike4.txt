Control Action (CA):
The automotive vehicle is steering.

Scene Description:
- Weather: Clear and dry; no rain or moisture present on the surface.
- Time: Daytime — sunlight is strong with some shadows cast by lamps and buildings.
- Road: Narrow two-lane residential street, **closely bordered by buildings**, with **motorbike visible in the distance** and **street lights and poles near the curb**.
- Environment Complexity: Moderate — few dynamic agents, but **tight lane width**, **urban geometry**, and **reduced lateral margin** near infrastructure.
- Sensor Visibility Risk: Low to Moderate — visibility is good, but **urban clutter**, **shadowing**, and **long-range motorbike detection** affect early reaction accuracy.

Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs):
- UCA1.1: AV misjudges the approaching motorbike’s speed and triggers early avoidance. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.2: AV delays steering due to uncertainty in lane spacing within the narrow street. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.3: AV initiates steering too soon, adjusting for an obstacle that is still distant. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.4: AV withholds steering while seeking clearance that does not require correction yet. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.5: AV maintains a lane adjustment too long, veering near curbs or street infrastructure. [H1, H3]
- UCA2.1: AV terminates the steering before full lane alignment is reached due to misclassified motorbike behavior. [H2, H3]

Loss Scenario Log:
- t0: UCA1.3 → AV begins steering in anticipation of the motorbike at a distance, despite available space.
- t1: UCA1.5 → Continued lateral shift causes drift toward sidewalk or lamp posts.
- t2: UCA2.1 → AV concludes maneuver without full lateral correction, remaining slightly off-center.

Causality:
- t0: Motorbike’s distant presence triggers overcautious trajectory change.
- t1: Steering response overshoots due to lack of real-time refinement near tight obstacles.
- t2: Early maneuver exit occurs based on incomplete threat resolution.

Final Loss: AV may operate off-center or too close to roadside objects due to early and sustained steering behavior in reaction to a distant motorbike.

Safe Scenario Log (Mitigated):
- t0: AV defers lateral change until motorbike behavior is better understood and within range.
- t1: Steering adjustments are gradual, constrained, and stay within defined road boundaries.
- t2: Final alignment is confirmed through curb/lane detection before ending maneuver.

Final Safe Outcome: AV maintains centered and safe trajectory within narrow urban road while tracking distant dynamic objects conservatively, avoiding overreaction or lateral drift.
