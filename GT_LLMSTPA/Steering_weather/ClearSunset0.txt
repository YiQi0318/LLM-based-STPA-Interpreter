Control Action (CA):
The automotive vehicle is steering.

Scene Description:
- Weather: Clear and dry — **no visible rain, moisture, or surface distortion**.
- Time: Sunset — **direct low-angle sunlight** casts long, sharp shadows from barriers and surroundings across the road.
- Road: Multi-lane highway with a gentle curve; **lane markings are present and generally clear**, though intersected by strong light/dark transitions.
- Environment Complexity: Low — no other vehicles or dynamic elements; static barriers along road edges.
- Sensor Visibility Risk: Moderate to High — **sharp lighting contrasts and shadows** may lead to misclassification of lane boundaries or visual occlusion during perception.

Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs):
- UCA1.1: AV mistakes shadows as solid lane boundaries or road edge lines. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.2: AV hesitates to steer due to obscured lane lines in high-contrast transitions. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.3: AV triggers steering too early in response to apparent curves generated by light boundaries. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.4: AV delays corrective action while seeking visual clarity in shadow-interrupted regions. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.5: Steering persists longer than needed from unstable or noisy contrast-dependent perception. [H1, H3]
- UCA2.1: AV terminates the correction prematurely, assuming visual alignment from misleading shadows. [H2, H3]

Loss Scenario Log:
- t0: UCA1.1, UCA1.3 → Shadow lines from barriers trigger early and incorrect steering behavior.
- t1: UCA1.5 → Steering input continues past target due to persistent uncertainty in visual alignment.
- t2: UCA2.1 → AV ends correction without validating true lane position because of distorted lighting.

Causality:
- t0: AV perception is misled by high-contrast shadow geometry resembling lane features.
- t1: Low confidence in visual feedback under mixed lighting results in prolonged correction.
- t2: Perceived alignment is assumed from flawed visual cues rather than confirmed by reliable data.

Final Loss: AV may be misaligned or shift laterally within the lane due to harsh sunset lighting degrading contrast-based vision.

Safe Scenario Log (Mitigated):
- t0: AV filters shadows using adaptive thresholding and confirms with map or radar.
- t1: Steering is applied smoothly with safeguards for feedback under contrast shifts.
- t2: Maneuver completes only after visual and inertial confirmation of proper alignment.

Final Safe Outcome: AV safely navigates shadow-heavy sunset scenes through multi-sensor validation and perception robustness to lighting artifacts.
