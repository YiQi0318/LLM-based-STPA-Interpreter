CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Risk of vehicle lane deviation and unstable response due to persistent surface water and deteriorated markings.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Support safe operation through consistent structure.
Contribution:
- Multiple visible water pools reduce grip.
- Slight visual cues of subsurface erosion or patchwork.
- Maintenance likely reactive rather than planned.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Define safe trajectory and spacing.
Contribution:
- Water obscures several lane segments.
- Existing markings lack resilience to remain visible.
- No physical or digital augmentation for wet clarity.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Detect and respond to lane/environment cues.
Contribution:
- May incorrectly interpret ambiguous lane boundaries.
- Hydroplaning or slipping risk increases in affected areas.
- Adaptive cruise or lane features become unreliable.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Ensure continual road safety.
Contribution:
- System failed to adapt surface for drainage efficacy.
- Neglected marking upgrades or post-rain inspection.
- Lack of responsive warning systems.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Navigate safely under degraded input.
Contribution:
- Risky adjustments due to visual confusion.
- Failure to react to loss of lane feedback promptly.
- Errors propagate from unclear environment.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide hazard awareness.
Contribution:
- No indication of intelligent warning system active.
- Static signage insufficient for dynamic road state.

Summary:
Compromised physical conditions and unreliable marking visibility undermine both manual and automated driving safety, showing systemic weakness in design, upkeep, and communication.
