CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Increased risk of intersection misjudgment due to snow-covered surface, yellow signal ambiguity, and low traction at a decision-critical point.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide vehicle stability and clear spatial boundaries.
Contribution:
- Entire surface is snow-covered, eliminating visual lane boundaries.
- Potentially reduced friction and extended stopping distances at the intersection.
- Curved curb edges partially buried, further reducing spatial reference.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Convey traffic control instructions and lane structure.
Contribution:
- No visible road markings due to snow.
- No painted stop lines, arrows, or lane dividers for intersection management.
- Traffic light present but lacks supporting surface cues for proper alignment.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Interpret surroundings, guide decisions, and maintain safety.
Contribution:
- Lane perception systems likely fail or disengage due to lack of markings.
- Sensor misinterpretation possible if curbs or terrain boundaries are buried.
- Braking and traction systems under stress in slick snow-covered conditions.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Provide safe, adaptive infrastructure under varied conditions.
Contribution:
- No visible evidence of snow clearing or anti-skid treatment at the intersection.
- Infrastructure provides only static control through traffic light; no adaptive features.
- Visual support tools (reflectors, snow posts, digital indicators) absent.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Evaluate intersection timing, positioning, and behavior.
Contribution:
- Yellow light demands split-second judgment, complicated by low traction.
- Lack of stop line or lane guidance increases uncertainty in approach.
- Drivers may under- or over-commit due to reduced visual and tactile feedback.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Warn and inform users of relevant conditions.
Contribution:
- No active signage or alerting about snowy surface or decision hazards.
- No feedback loop between environment and driver/system.
- Missed opportunity for speed or caution prompt before critical intersection.

Summary:
This image shows a snow-covered intersection with a yellow traffic light, where surface traction is compromised and visual cues are mostly absent. The combination of timing sensitivity, snow-related uncertainty, and lack of guidance systems makes this a high-risk moment for both human and automated control.
