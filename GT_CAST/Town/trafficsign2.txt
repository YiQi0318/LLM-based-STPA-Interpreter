CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Elevated risk of misjudgment in speed control or vehicle stability due to snow-covered roads, reduced contrast, and urban layout complexity.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide safe traction and reliable driving conditions.
Contribution:
- Road is covered with snow, significantly reducing friction.
- Surface features and markings are not visible due to snow coverage.
- Increased chance of skidding, delayed braking, or lane ambiguity.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Indicate legal and navigational boundaries.
Contribution:
- Lane markings are mostly obscured or lost in the snow.
- Speed limit sign (60) is clearly visible and positioned properly.
- Visual lane boundaries are unclear, especially for new or unfamiliar drivers.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Perceive road conditions and manage safe navigation.
Contribution:
- Lane-keeping and visual guidance systems will struggle due to lack of visible lines.
- Traction and stability control systems may be active or intermittently engaged.
- Sign detection is feasible, but overall navigation confidence is reduced.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Maintain road visibility and minimize environmental hazards.
Contribution:
- No snow clearing or lane visibility enhancements observed.
- No secondary safety systems (e.g., reflectors, snow poles) to assist during snow.
- Maintenance not responsive to active weather impacts on driving safety.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Interpret signage, conditions, and operate safely.
Contribution:
- May misjudge speed or spacing due to invisible lane boundaries.
- Risk of over-speeding or underestimating stopping distance.
- Snow glare may reduce visual comfort or cue clarity.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide environmental hazard alerts and real-time guidance.
Contribution:
- No dynamic signage or alerts for snow-related driving conditions.
- System does not appear to influence behavior or inform drivers.
- Environmental awareness support is absent.

Summary:
This snowy urban scenario presents a high-risk environment where lane cues are obscured and traction is reduced. Although the speed limit is clear, the lack of visual lane definition and real-time condition mitigation creates systemic strain on both human and automated navigation.
