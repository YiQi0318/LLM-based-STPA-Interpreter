CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Loss of visual guidance and potential for hydroplaning due to heavy rainfall, road surface saturation, and low marking visibility.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide traction and support water removal.
Contribution:
- Entire surface is saturated by continuous heavy rain.
- Surface shows pooling and extensive reflective glare.
- Drainage system appears overwhelmed or underdesigned for high-intensity rain.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Guide vehicle positioning and provide safety cues.
Contribution:
- Lane markings are barely visible through the water layer.
- Rainfall and reflection eliminate contrast needed for both human and sensor detection.
- Markings are not adapted for wet-weather visibility (e.g., reflective or textured paint).

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Maintain control and perception accuracy.
Contribution:
- Lane detection systems likely fail or operate with high uncertainty.
- Hydroplaning and delayed braking responses are likely due to poor friction.
- Automation may disengage entirely or behave unpredictably.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Design and maintain road readiness for weather.
Contribution:
- No visible indicators or systems to mitigate wet road risk.
- Lane markings are insufficient for adverse weather operation.
- Emergency signage, lighting, or temporary speed enforcement absent.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Control vehicle using environmental inputs.
Contribution:
- Visual overload and low contrast impair decision-making.
- High risk of misjudging lane position or braking distance.
- Confidence in infrastructure support significantly reduced.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Warn users of active road risks.
Contribution:
- No dynamic signage or alerts present during hazardous rain conditions.
- System does not provide in-situ environmental hazard feedback.
- Failure to prompt behavior adjustment in response to worsening conditions.

Summary:
This represents a high-risk driving environment with near-total loss of lane visibility and surface control reliability under heavy rain. Systemic issues—such as insufficient marking contrast, poor drainage, and lack of hazard alerting—contribute to a critically unsafe scenario for both manual and autonomous navigation.
