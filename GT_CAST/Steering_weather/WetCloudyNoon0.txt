CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Increased likelihood of driver uncertainty or system misalignment due to isolated water patches and degraded lane markings.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Surface condition for safe vehicle operation.
Contribution:
- Presence of a large, visible water patch suggests insufficient drainage.
- Surface shows mild discoloration or wear in specific areas.
- Maintenance does not appear to address localized pooling or texture issues.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Visual orientation and lane boundary definition.
Contribution:
- Markings are faded and inconsistent in contrast.
- Water presence may temporarily obscure parts of the lane lines.
- No reflective or reinforced markings present to counter low-visibility conditions.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Onboard safety and navigation support.
Contribution:
- Lane-keeping systems may falter in identifying correct lanes.
- Wet surface could reduce effectiveness of braking and stability systems.
- Vision-based automation systems face reliability issues in degraded marking environments.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Infrastructure management and hazard prevention.
Contribution:
- Lane repainting and drainage systems appear under-maintained.
- No visible alerts, cones, or markings to indicate road condition risks.
- Lacks proactive hazard mitigation or temporary interventions.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Decision-makers under sensory and visual feedback.
Contribution:
- Driver may hesitate or miscalculate lane alignment.
- Reaction time could be delayed by inconsistent lane visuals.
- Reliance on degraded road cues elevates risk of overcorrection.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Communicates risk conditions to drivers and systems.
Contribution:
- No active signage or alert system visible for wet road warnings.
- Drivers may be unaware of slippery zones until directly encountered.
- Static systems fail to communicate dynamic road state.

Summary:
This scenario reveals an environment where visual degradation and surface hazards exist at a manageable but significant level. When unaddressed, these conditions challenge both human drivers and automated systems, making error more likely in high-speed or high-traffic situations.
