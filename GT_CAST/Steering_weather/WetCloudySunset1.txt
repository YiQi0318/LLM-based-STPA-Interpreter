CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Elevated accident potential due to water coverage obscuring lane boundaries and visual degradation.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Road reliability and hazard resistance.
Contribution:
- Water coverage continues across multiple lanes.
- Surface wear increases risk under braking or acceleration.
- Maintenance lacking in water management strategy.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Driver guidance infrastructure.
Contribution:
- Lane visibility hindered by water film and fading.
- Markings are unreliable for human or autonomous perception.
- Reflective coating absent or ineffective in wet state.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Vehicle-road interface systems.
Contribution:
- Vision-dependent systems will misinterpret lanes.
- Traction control stress increases over wet patches.
- Braking behavior affected by uneven water layer.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Maintenance and hazard prevention.
Contribution:
- No evidence of pre-rain preparations or real-time alerts.
- Long-term degradation suggests poor performance tracking.
- Emergency measures (cones, signs) missing.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Operational decision-making.
Contribution:
- Underestimate loss of grip and lane confusion.
- Delayed or incorrect steering due to visual misinterpretation.
- Lack of feedback increases anxiety or overcompensation.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Risk signaling infrastructure.
Contribution:
- No data delivered to drivers through signs or warnings.
- Absence of predictive response for pooling regions.

Summary:
The system is operating under degraded visual and physical safety conditions. Both technical (vehicle) and human agents are impacted by the road authorityâ€™s failure to prevent or respond to water-induced risks.
