CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Loss of directional control or hazard misjudgment due to extensive water presence and obscured lanes.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Platform integrity and fluid management.
Contribution:
- Water stretches nearly the full lane width in areas.
- Likely accumulation from poor surface leveling.
- Repair scheduling may not prioritize safety-critical updates.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Directional and positional information.
Contribution:
- Faded markings lead to uncertainty under wet reflection.
- No visibility optimization for poor lighting or wet roads.
- Absence of clear reflective cues impairs interpretation.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Environmentally reactive modules.
Contribution:
- Sensors may misjudge water as clear surface.
- Lane departure warnings disabled or inaccurate.
- Loss of friction leads to lower braking performance.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Upkeep, inspection, and mitigation.
Contribution:
- No signs of rapid response or temporary visual guidance.
- Failure to evaluate post-storm safety performance.
- No manual or automatic mitigation tools visible.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Responsible actor using system feedback.
Contribution:
- Misinterpretation of road boundaries and surface condition.
- Steering adjustments based on poor visual data.
- High stress or split-second decisions increase error rate.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Augment situational awareness.
Contribution:
- No real-time feedback or hazard alert systems detected.
- No integration of weather and surface state warning logic.

Summary:
A combination of severe surface wetness and lack of marking clarity creates a hazardous and high-uncertainty environment. The breakdown affects both technical vehicle systems and manual operation alike.
