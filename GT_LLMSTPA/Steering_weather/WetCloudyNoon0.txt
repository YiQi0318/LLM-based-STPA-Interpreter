Control Action (CA):
The automotive vehicle is steering.

Scene Description:
- Weather: Wet surface with extensive puddling and water streaks; consistent with recent rainfall.
- Time: Late afternoon under overcast/cloudy skies; diffused lighting with soft shadows.
- Road: Multi-lane highway with visible curve; **lane markings are intermittently obscured** by reflective wet patches.
- Environment Complexity: Low — no vehicles or pedestrians present, standard road barriers in view.
- Sensor Visibility Risk: High — **surface reflections and puddles** reduce the accuracy of lane detection and steering alignment.

Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs):
- UCA1.1: AV interprets water reflections or patches as lane boundaries or barriers. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.2: AV avoids steering due to low-confidence or ambiguous lane detection. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.3: AV initiates steering too early based on misinterpreted surface cues. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.4: AV delays steering waiting for lane clarification. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.5: Steering held too long in the absence of clear feedback, resulting in lateral drift. [H1, H3]
- UCA2.1: AV stops steering prematurely, before actual alignment is verified. [H2, H3]

Loss Scenario Log:
- t0: UCA1.1, UCA1.3 → AV detects lane markings distorted by water and initiates incorrect early steering.
- t1: UCA1.5 → Overcorrection due to inconsistent visual input causes the vehicle to drift.
- t2: UCA2.1 → Steering ends before true alignment is achieved, resulting in unstable trajectory.

Causality:
- t0: Reflection artifacts are falsely interpreted as navigable features.
- t1: Feedback loop is impaired by wet-surface-induced visual noise.
- t2: Premature correction termination results from misjudged lane centering.

Final Loss: The AV may remain misaligned or exit its lane due to visual confusion from wet patches and insufficient correction feedback.

Safe Scenario Log (Mitigated):
- t0: AV uses sensor fusion and waits for confident lane detection before initiating steering.
- t1: AV applies incremental, monitored corrections, compensating for visual artifacts.
- t2: Steering continues until visual confirmation of center alignment is verified.

Final Safe Outcome: The AV adapts t
