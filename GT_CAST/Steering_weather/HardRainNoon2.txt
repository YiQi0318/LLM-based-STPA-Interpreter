CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: High risk of perception failure and vehicle control instability due to heavy rain, surface saturation, and diminished lane visibility.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Enable safe vehicular travel by providing traction and water management.
Contribution:
- Entire surface is rain-slicked with evidence of water buildup.
- Surface sheen suggests loss of friction across most of the road.
- Drainage effectiveness appears insufficient for heavy rainfall scenarios.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Guide drivers and support automation through visual lane cues.
Contribution:
- Lane markings are faint and obscured by water and glare.
- Lack of high-contrast or rain-resistant markings reduces detectability.
- No signage present to alert drivers of visibility or grip reduction.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Maintain control and respond to environmental conditions.
Contribution:
- Lane assist and camera-based guidance systems likely degraded.
- High potential for hydroplaning and increased braking distance.
- Sensors may fail to reliably interpret lane boundaries.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Infrastructure maintenance and adaptive hazard mitigation.
Contribution:
- No real-time alert systems or surface treatment for high rainfall conditions.
- Paint maintenance and drainage solutions appear inadequate.
- No supplementary visual or physical warning features in place.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Interpret road cues and maintain control in poor visibility.
Contribution:
- Drivers may be unable to distinguish lanes or anticipate surface behavior.
- Heavy rain reduces reaction time and increases error likelihood.
- Risk of drifting or oversteering due to visual and traction degradation.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide dynamic alerts regarding environmental risks.
Contribution:
- No active signage or automated alerts visible during heavy rain.
- System does not provide real-time warnings for slick road conditions.
- No integrated weather-response infrastructure in use.

Summary:
This scenario exhibits systemic vulnerability under heavy rain. Low-contrast markings, poor drainage, and lack of adaptive communication severely compromise both human and automated driving. Without mitigations, the likelihood of vehicle deviation or control loss is significantly elevated.
