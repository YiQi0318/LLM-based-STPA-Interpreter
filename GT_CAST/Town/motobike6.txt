CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Risk of lane discipline issues or missed hazard detection due to snow-covered lanes, speed management ambiguity, and mixed road usage by motorbikes and vehicles.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Ensure safe traction and delineation of lane boundaries.
Contribution:
- Road is snow-covered, erasing most lane markings.
- Uneven snow coverage introduces patches of low-traction and unclear spatial structure.
- No evidence of snow removal or surface treatment for safe driving.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Provide navigational cues and regulatory information.
Contribution:
- Centerline is barely visible; edge lines and bike lanes are not present.
- Speed limit sign (30) is clearly visible, but lane usage and position cues are lacking.
- No signs or markings specific to shared use with motorcycles or bicycles.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Detect road elements, maintain stability, and respond to dynamic objects.
Contribution:
- Lane-tracking features likely impaired due to faded markings and snow cover.
- Motorcycles may be harder to detect in snowy conditions with reduced contrast.
- Subsystems face challenges maintaining lateral stability and accurate object prediction.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Ensure infrastructure safety and clarity for mixed vehicle usage.
Contribution:
- Snow maintenance appears neglected; surface and curb visibility degraded.
- No bike lane delineation or surface texture adjustments for motorcycles.
- Speed regulation signage exists but is not supported by contextual safety measures.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Adjust driving based on cues, conditions, and other road users.
Contribution:
- Drivers may misjudge motorcycle position or intent due to low surface visibility.
- Unclear lane divisions and snow may reduce confidence in overtaking or following distance.
- Increased risk of maneuvering error or inadequate response to motorbike dynamics.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide hazard alerts based on environmental changes.
Contribution:
- No adaptive warning systems or alerts visible in the environment.
- No indication of snow hazard messaging or speed adjustments.
- System lacks integration with seasonal or visibility-reducing weather patterns.

Summary:
This snowy mixed-use road introduces moderate operational risk, particularly for interactions between cars and motorcycles. The absence of clear lane markings, no bike-specific infrastructure, and untreated snow reduce the ability of both human and machine operators to maintain safety and predictability.
