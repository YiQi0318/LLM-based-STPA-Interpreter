CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Potential for misinterpretation or unsafe maneuvering due to limited lane demarcation, signal-only control, and motorbike-specific visibility constraints.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide stable conditions for maneuvering and braking.
Contribution:
- Road surface is dry and well-maintained.
- No potholes, debris, or surface irregularities visible.
- No textural differences to indicate bike lanes or shoulders.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Indicate road structure, regulations, and user priorities.
Contribution:
- Single yellow centerline present; no side markings or dedicated bike/motorcycle lanes.
- Green traffic light visible and functioning but lacks contextual signage or lane control.
- No auxiliary signs (e.g., speed, intersection warning) near signal.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Detect road boundaries, traffic controls, and dynamic actors.
Contribution:
- Lane tracking depends entirely on the single centerline; system may have limited lateral accuracy.
- Motorcycle detection must rely on motion or LIDAR due to lack of road context.
- Signal detection is strong, but maneuvering logic may lack guidance near intersections.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Provide infrastructure that supports diverse vehicle types and safe intersection behavior.
Contribution:
- No dedicated or marked space for motorcycles.
- Signalized control exists but is not augmented with clear lane direction or indicators.
- Intersection lacks pre-signal indicators, slowing areas, or structural cues.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Observe and respond safely to road, signal, and adjacent vehicles.
Contribution:
- Drivers may struggle to anticipate motorbike intent due to ambiguous lane structure.
- Misjudgment may occur during passing, lane-sharing, or stopping.
- Signal presence helps, but no road-based alignment reduces predictability.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide hazard alerts and contextual environment info.
Contribution:
- Clear weather means no hazard, but no dynamic system is present to aid in decision-making.
- No feedback mechanisms, such as dynamic signage or adaptive signaling.
- Environment is static and lacks responsiveness to mixed-use conditions.

Summary:
This simple urban scene with a motorbike and signalized control presents a low to moderate level of risk. While the weather and surface are ideal, the lack of markings and contextual infrastructure introduces ambiguityâ€”particularly in supporting safe navigation for motorcycles and predicting interactions with surrounding traffic.
