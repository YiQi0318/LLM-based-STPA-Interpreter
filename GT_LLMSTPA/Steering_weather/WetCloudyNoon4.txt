Control Action (CA):
The automotive vehicle is steering.

Scene Description:
- Weather: Wet road surface with multiple large puddles and high reflectivity; indicates recent rainfall.
- Time: Late afternoon or early evening under cloudy sky; ambient lighting is soft and shadowless.
- Road: Multi-lane highway with a slight curve; **lane markings are partially obscured** by standing water and glare.
- Environment Complexity: Low — no traffic, no pedestrians, no dynamic obstacles.
- Sensor Visibility Risk: High — reflections from puddles, water-induced surface artifacts, and glare can confuse lane detection and cause perception errors.

Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs):
- UCA1.1: AV misreads puddles or reflections as lane lines or physical barriers. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.2: AV fails to steer due to occluded or uncertain lane position. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.3: Steering begins too early based on false or distorted lane detection. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.4: AV delays steering due to waiting for visual disambiguation. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.5: AV maintains steering too long, drifting laterally due to uncertain visual cues. [H1, H3]
- UCA2.1: AV ends steering too soon under the impression of correct alignment. [H2, H3]

Loss Scenario Log:
- t0: UCA1.1, UCA1.3 → AV initiates steering from misinterpreted water reflection, resulting in misalignment.
- t1: UCA1.5 → AV continues adjusting steering, but due to poor feedback, drifts out of center lane.
- t2: UCA2.1 → AV terminates correction early before true lane centering is achieved.

Causality:
- t0: Misleading surface reflections create incorrect initial path.
- t1: Overcorrection caused by visual uncertainty results in lateral deviation.
- t2: Premature correction termination leaves AV uncentered.

Final Loss: AV risks unstable lane positioning and lateral drift due to persistent visual distortion and premature steering decisions.

Safe Scenario Log (Mitigated):
- t0: AV waits for verified multi-sensor lane detection before steering.
- t1: Steering corrections are moderated and guided by redundant perception input.
- t2: Final alignment achieved before releasing steering command, ensuring centered lane position.

Final Safe Outcome: AV adapts to reflective and wet road conditions through robust perception and controlled maneuvering, maintaining safe and accurate lane alignment.
