CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Risk of vehicle misalignment or reduced control due to patchy water presence and faint lane markings.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Base condition for vehicle traction and safety.
Contribution:
- Water patches visible, indicating inadequate drainage.
- Surface appears uneven in tone, possibly affecting consistency in grip.
- Preventive maintenance efforts appear limited or delayed.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Guide driver and vehicle positioning.
Contribution:
- Lane markings are faint and degraded in visibility.
- Uneven visibility can lead to driver confusion during lane changes or merges.
- No reflective enhancements to maintain visibility in wet conditions.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: In-vehicle safety and perception systems.
Contribution:
- Lane departure systems may fail due to unclear markings.
- Hydroplaning risk if tires encounter residual water at speed.
- Braking and stability systems under increased stress on mixed-surface conditions.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Maintenance, inspection, and hazard mitigation.
Contribution:
- Lack of lane repainting indicates reactive rather than proactive management.
- No visible signs to inform drivers of potentially slick conditions.
- Surface condition suggests need for drainage re-evaluation.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Human interpretation and response.
Contribution:
- Drivers may struggle to identify lane centers or boundaries.
- Risk of oversteering or understeering when encountering unclear sections.
- Perception compromised by a combination of surface inconsistency and marking fade.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide awareness of environmental driving risks.
Contribution:
- No visual or electronic alerts observed for wet pavement.
- Drivers may enter affected areas unaware of surface risk.
- Absence of localized updates reduces system reliability.

Summary:
The image reflects a scenario with moderate but significant road surface and visual degradation. These factors compromise lane recognition and safe maneuvering, impacting both human drivers and vehicle autonomy systems.
