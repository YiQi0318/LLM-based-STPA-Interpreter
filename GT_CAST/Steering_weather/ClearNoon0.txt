CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Minimal chance of lane interpretation error, with possible mild visual degradation from glare and faded lane markings under bright clear noon conditions.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Support safe vehicle operation through structural stability and friction.
Contribution:
- Surface is clean, dry, and smooth.
- No visible debris or irregularities.
- High sunlight reflectance could reduce visual distinction of fine surface details.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Provide spatial orientation and lane delineation.
Contribution:
- Markings are present but somewhat faded.
- Low visual contrast under bright midday light may hinder clarity.
- No enhancements (e.g., retroreflective materials) for optimal visibility in strong sunlight.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Support automated perception, lane tracking, and driver assistance.
Contribution:
- Vision-based lane detection systems may operate at reduced confidence.
- Marking fade and glare could cause minor path prediction uncertainty.
- Automation reliability is slightly affected but generally functional.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Ensure infrastructure visibility, safety, and condition maintenance.
Contribution:
- No evidence of recent repainting or visual optimization.
- Lack of contrast-adaptive markings reduces clarity in high-illumination settings.
- Visual maintenance suitable for dry conditions but not peak sunlight effectiveness.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Use visual input to guide safe driving behavior.
Contribution:
- Bright sunlight and faded markings may slow visual recognition of lane structure.
- Minimal distraction or hesitation possible when interpreting lane shifts or merges.
- Overall visual comfort may be reduced in extended exposure.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide guidance for environmental visibility and driving conditions.
Contribution:
- No active alerts or visual systems indicating visibility reduction from glare.
- No forecast-linked signage or adaptive feedback detected.
- Missed opportunity for awareness of high-sun visual strain risks.

Summary:
This is a low-risk daylight driving scenario in ideal physical conditions. However, faded markings and glare reduce visual sharpness for both human and machine systems, introducing a slight potential for degraded perception during lane alignment or transitions.
