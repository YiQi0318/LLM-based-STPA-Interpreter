CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Potential for conflict at signalized intersection due to undefined bicycle lane structure, unclear prioritization, and mixed traffic in a visually complex urban environment.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide stable and distinguishable travel paths.
Contribution:
- Surface is clean and dry, with no apparent damage or obstruction.
- No dedicated bicycle lane or surface cues for cyclist alignment.
- Uniform surface texture provides no spatial prioritization for different road users.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Inform traffic behavior and enforce path separation.
Contribution:
- A single yellow centerline is visible; no directional or boundary markings.
- No road markings or signage specific to bicycle behavior or intersection approach.
- Signal is present and green, but not supported with auxiliary guidance for cyclists.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Detect and predict road users' paths for safe interaction.
Contribution:
- Cyclist detection required without aid of dedicated road markers.
- Green signal interpreted as free passage, but no spatial logic to predict cyclist lateral motion.
- Urban structures may cast shadows affecting detection or classification reliability.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Provide road infrastructure supporting multimodal safety.
Contribution:
- Intersection lacks cycle-specific signage, markings, or protective buffering.
- No raised platforms, bike boxes, or visual separation to guide conflict-free passage.
- Signal is generic and not adaptive to cyclist behavior or flow.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Navigate intersections with awareness of vulnerable road users.
Contribution:
- Without markings, drivers must infer cyclist trajectory.
- Risk of misunderstanding right-of-way or misjudging relative speed.
- High urban visual density may contribute to inattentional blindness.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Support environmental awareness and risk forecasting.
Contribution:
- Clear weather and daylight provide good visibility.
- No dynamic feedback, cyclist alerts, or variable speed advisories in use.
- System remains passive and unresponsive to active bicycle presence.

Summary:
This intersection scenario presents moderate risk for cyclist safety. While the environment is physically safe and signalized, the absence of visual structure or cyclist-specific infrastructure places high cognitive demand on both drivers and autonomous systems, increasing the probability of late reaction or miscoordination.
