CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Elevated risk of vehicle-bicycle conflict due to lack of dedicated infrastructure, shared lane ambiguity, and presence of fast-moving traffic in a visually cluttered environment.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide physical safety and clear guidance for all road users.
Contribution:
- Road surface is dry and in good condition with no visible damage.
- No textured or colored markings to indicate bike-friendly lanes or shoulders.
- Lane visual guidance is minimal and non-specific to vehicle type.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Communicate traffic expectations and spatial organization.
Contribution:
- A centerline is visible but no edge or bike lane markings are present.
- Speed limit sign (60 km/h) is clearly visible, possibly high for a mixed-use corridor.
- No signage indicating bicycle presence or right-of-way adjustments.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Perceive environment and adjust behavior based on dynamic actors.
Contribution:
- Bicycle tracking may be challenging due to scale, side positioning, and background complexity.
- Lack of infrastructure guidance increases dependency on object detection and predictive modeling.
- Systems may struggle with determining cyclist trajectory and buffer zone.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Design and maintain infrastructure for safe co-existence of vehicles and bicycles.
Contribution:
- No bike lanes or protective buffers visible.
- Speed limit may be excessive given the presence of a vulnerable road user.
- Urban layout lacks calming measures, curb protections, or cycle-aware signage.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Maintain safe interaction with vulnerable road users.
Contribution:
- Driver may underestimate space required when passing the cyclist.
- Lane ambiguity could lead to unsafe overtaking or tailgating.
- Visual distractions from parked and moving vehicles increase cognitive load.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Alert users of dynamic risk or environmental changes.
Contribution:
- Clear weather reduces environmental hazard but no support system is visible.
- No electronic warnings, dynamic signals, or cyclist alerts in operation.
- Passive environment with no adaptive safety enhancement.

Summary:
This scene presents a moderate to high safety risk for the cyclist due to inadequate road design for shared use, high posted speed, and lack of visual or structural protection. The absence of cycle-specific markings and signage limits both driver awareness and automated system adaptability in real-time.
