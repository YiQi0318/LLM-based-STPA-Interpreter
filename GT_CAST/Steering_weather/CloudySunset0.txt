CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Potential for misalignment or decreased automation reliability due to low-contrast visibility and faint lane markings in cloudy sunset conditions.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Support safe vehicle operation with reliable traction and visibility.
Contribution:
- Surface is dry and in good structural condition.
- No debris or surface damage detected.
- Visual texture is uniform, but lacks high contrast with markings.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Provide lane guidance and spatial awareness.
Contribution:
- Lane lines are faded and difficult to distinguish under soft lighting.
- Lack of retroreflectivity or enhanced contrast features.
- Markings do not accommodate variable lighting scenarios such as sunset/cloud cover.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Detect lanes, regulate position, and assist with navigation.
Contribution:
- Lane-keeping systems may fail or provide low-confidence outputs.
- Vision-based systems may struggle to track center or boundaries accurately.
- Visual input degradation limits function of many ADAS tools.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Ensure infrastructure supports visual and operational safety.
Contribution:
- Lane markings appear overdue for refresh or enhancement.
- No additional visual aids (e.g., catâ€™s eyes, reflective paint) to support visibility.
- No adaptive or weather-aware features in the road infrastructure.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Interpret conditions and navigate vehicle appropriately.
Contribution:
- Low visibility of markings may result in drift or delayed decisions.
- Visual fatigue or misjudgment may occur under soft, indirect lighting.
- Increased cognitive load without supporting cues.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Inform drivers of condition-related hazards.
Contribution:
- No signage or system alerting to limited lane visibility.
- No real-time condition feedback to adjust driver behavior.
- Missed opportunity to integrate lighting awareness into system alerts.

Summary:
The physical condition of the road is good, but the visual conditions pose a risk due to low contrast and faded markings. This affects both human perception and automated system functionality, creating moderate navigation uncertainty in cloudy sunset environments.
