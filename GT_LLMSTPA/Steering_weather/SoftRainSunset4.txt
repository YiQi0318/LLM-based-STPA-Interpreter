Control Action (CA):
The automotive vehicle is steering.

Scene Description:
- Weather: Wet road surface with **scattered puddles and surface gloss**; suggests light or recent rain.
- Time: Sunset or late afternoon with diffuse lighting and mild glare.
- Road: Multi-lane highway, subtle curve; **lane markings are mostly visible** but pass through areas of reflection and dark wet patches.
- Environment Complexity: Low — no other vehicles or objects; bordered by barriers.
- Sensor Visibility Risk: Moderate to High — **reflections and irregular water patterns** may lead to inconsistent lane detection and momentary perception degradation.

Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs):
- UCA1.1: AV misinterprets water edges or surface brightness as lane features. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.2: AV fails to steer because water-covered markings are momentarily lost. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.3: AV steers too early due to premature detection of distorted lane lines. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.4: AV delays steering while awaiting improved clarity or cross-sensor confirmation. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.5: AV holds steering too long in absence of clear positional feedback. [H1, H3]
- UCA2.1: AV stops steering too early due to false confidence in trajectory stability. [H2, H3]

Loss Scenario Log:
- t0: UCA1.1, UCA1.3 → Early steering initiated due to misinterpreted water patches or brightness.
- t1: UCA1.5 → Prolonged steering in response to uncertainty causes AV to veer.
- t2: UCA2.1 → Correction ends before proper re-centering, leaving vehicle off-path.

Causality:
- t0: Vision system overreacts to puddle reflectivity as lane geometry.
- t1: Insufficient visual feedback extends correction beyond necessary bounds.
- t2: AV prematurely terminates correction phase before visual alignment is confirmed.

Final Loss: AV may deviate from the lane or remain misaligned due to soft-rain conditions affecting clarity of visual references.

Safe Scenario Log (Mitigated):
- t0: Steering initiated only after high-confidence lane detection via fused sensors.
- t1: Minor, real-time adjustments help maintain trajectory through ambiguous patches.
- t2: Steering ends only after full lateral position is confirmed via perception validation.

Final Safe Outcome: AV remains safely aligned despite environmental visual challenges, using robust steering behavior and perception redundancy to offset soft rain and surface reflectivity.
