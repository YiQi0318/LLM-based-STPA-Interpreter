CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Increased potential for control instability or lane recognition failure due to surface wetness, pooled water, and faint lane markings during moderate rain.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Ensure safety through adequate friction and drainage.
Contribution:
- Widespread water patches visible across multiple lanes.
- Surface shows irregularities where water accumulates.
- Lack of proper drainage exacerbates hydroplaning risks.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Provide lane guidance and spatial awareness.
Contribution:
- Lane markings are faint and largely obscured by water glare.
- Visibility significantly reduced in central and right lanes.
- No reflective or raised markings adapted for wet visibility conditions.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Enable automated and assisted control functions.
Contribution:
- Lane-keeping assistance likely degraded due to obscured markings.
- Braking and steering systems face reduced efficiency in wet zones.
- Perception sensors may misread lane structure or return null input.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Manage road quality and driver communication.
Contribution:
- Markings appear worn and neglected, especially under wet exposure.
- No real-time signage or physical indicators for hazardous conditions.
- Absence of adaptive infrastructure or weather-prepared maintenance strategy.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Interpret the road and operate the vehicle under uncertainty.
Contribution:
- Drivers may misjudge vehicle position relative to lanes.
- Standing water can induce oversteering or panic braking.
- Visual stress and reduced confidence increase reaction time errors.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide environment-driven hazard alerts.
Contribution:
- No visible notification of wet or slippery conditions.
- System lacks adaptive or real-time warning capability.
- Missed opportunity to guide driver behavior during active rainfall.

Summary:
This scene represents a moderate to high-risk road condition with multiple compounding factors: pooled water, degraded lane markings, and the absence of real-time alerts. These conditions limit both human and machine control fidelity, increasing the chance of lane departure or loss of stability.
