CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: High risk of cyclist-vehicle intersection conflict due to ambiguous signaling context, lack of protected lane guidance, and inadequate infrastructure for safe bicycle navigation.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide structurally sound, high-visibility conditions for all users.
Contribution:
- Road is dry and in good physical condition.
- Lane markings are clearly visible but oriented toward vehicle use.
- No surface indicators for bicycle routing or separation from car traffic.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Define vehicle and cyclist pathways and communicate priority.
Contribution:
- Center and edge lines are defined, but no bicycle lane or guidance markers.
- Traffic light is yellow (transition state), increasing decision pressure.
- No signage indicating bicycle crossing priority, shared road use, or cyclist alerts.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Interpret the cyclistâ€™s motion and the traffic signal state for safe planning.
Contribution:
- Cyclist is centered in the lane but blends visually into the background.
- Signal is yellow, leading to prediction uncertainty in both motion planning and braking.
- Absence of dedicated guidance for cyclist reduces reliability of trajectory models.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Provide infrastructure and traffic systems suitable for multimodal use.
Contribution:
- No marked bicycle lanes or protection at the intersection.
- Traffic light is not bicycle-specific or adaptive to cyclist position.
- Urban planning favors vehicles, with limited structural support for vulnerable road users.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Anticipate cyclist movements and adapt accordingly.
Contribution:
- Cyclist position may be interpreted as vehicular or ambiguous.
- Yellow light may trigger abrupt decisions (e.g., speeding up or hard braking).
- Drivers may not expect cyclists at lane center without supporting infrastructure.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Issue contextual alerts and modify control systems based on environment.
Contribution:
- Conditions are clear and visibility is high, minimizing weather-based hazard.
- No dynamic signs, adaptive lighting, or cyclist-specific feedback present.
- No system present to provide real-time risk moderation or guidance.

Summary:
This scene introduces significant risk at a major intersection due to a transition-state traffic signal, absence of bicycle-specific infrastructure, and ambiguous positioning of the cyclist. Both automated systems and drivers may misinterpret cyclist behavior, leading to late or incorrect responses in a high-stakes traffic zone.
