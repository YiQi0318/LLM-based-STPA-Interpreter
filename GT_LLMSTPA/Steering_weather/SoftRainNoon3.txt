Control Action (CA):
The automotive vehicle is steering.

Scene Description:
- Weather: Lightly wet road surface with **minor water residue and isolated dark patches**; signs of soft or recent rainfall.
- Time: Noon or early afternoon — bright natural lighting with diffuse shadows.
- Road: Multi-lane highway; **lane markings are clearly visible**, though the surface shows slight glossiness and light reflection.
- Environment Complexity: Low — no vehicles, obstructions, or moving elements present.
- Sensor Visibility Risk: Low to Moderate — surface reflectivity and patchiness could slightly impair visual lane detection, especially at edges and center transitions.

Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs):
- UCA1.1: AV misinterprets glossy patches or faded textures as lane lines or road boundaries. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.2: AV fails to steer due to low visual confidence in a slightly occluded lane segment. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.3: AV steers prematurely, influenced by false surface cues. [H1, H2]
- UCA1.4: AV delays steering due to excessive caution under visually uncertain input. [H2, H3]
- UCA1.5: AV applies prolonged steering without validated alignment feedback. [H1, H3]
- UCA2.1: AV ends steering before actual realignment is confirmed. [H2, H3]

Loss Scenario Log:
- t0: UCA1.1, UCA1.3 → AV reacts too early to false lane features created by mid-glare and wet patches.
- t1: UCA1.5 → Steering input is extended beyond optimal range due to unclear edge contrast.
- t2: UCA2.1 → Correction ends before the AV achieves proper center position.

Causality:
- t0: Wet textures and surface gloss mislead vision system, triggering incorrect steering.
- t1: Prolonged correction from weak boundary feedback causes lateral offset.
- t2: AV prematurely concludes maneuver before lane confirmation is complete.

Final Loss: The AV becomes off-center or unstable in its lane, potentially drifting under low-friction conditions or unclear lane registration.

Safe Scenario Log (Mitigated):
- t0: AV verifies lane boundaries using multiple modalities before responding.
- t1: Steering input is applied gradually and monitored with real-time feedback.
- t2: Maneuver concludes only when lane alignment is confirmed and trajectory is stable.

Final Safe Outcome: The AV handles soft rain and bright midday conditions with controlled and validated steering, maintaining accurate and reliable lane alignment.
