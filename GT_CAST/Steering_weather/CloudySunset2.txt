CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Risk of lane deviation or delayed driver response due to low-contrast visual conditions and faded lane markings under cloudy lighting.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Maintain safe, reliable travel surface.
Contribution:
- Surface is dry and clear, but shows slight wear.
- No visible standing water or debris.
- Maintenance appears functional, though texture contrast is low.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Provide lane guidance and navigational cues.
Contribution:
- Lane markings are faint and inconsistent in visibility.
- Low-angle lighting from sunset and cloud cover reduces contrast.
- No enhanced visual aids (e.g., reflective paint, bold contrast lines) present.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Detect lanes, assist control, and maintain vehicle path.
Contribution:
- Lane detection may be less reliable due to faded markings.
- Vision-based systems may misinterpret or miss lane edges in low contrast.
- Driver-assist features dependent on markings may underperform.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Maintain infrastructure quality and safety systems.
Contribution:
- No recent repainting of lane lines evident.
- Markings are inadequately visible under varied lighting.
- No supporting infrastructure (e.g., reflective signs, adaptive marking) in place.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Perceive and navigate based on road cues.
Contribution:
- Cloudy lighting and weak line contrast may cause visual misinterpretation.
- Drivers may drift or delay decisions due to poor boundary definition.
- Eye strain or uncertainty may lead to compensatory behaviors.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide situational awareness and risk alerts.
Contribution:
- No dynamic warnings or feedback regarding reduced visibility.
- System does not appear to adjust to lighting/weather context.
- Lack of integration limits support for real-time driving behavior adjustment.

Summary:
While the surface is physically safe, the combination of faded markings and muted ambient light creates a visually ambiguous environment. This reduces effectiveness of both human and automated lane-following systems, introducing moderate risk in scenarios requiring precise navigation or quick decision-making.
