CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Decreased lane detection reliability and visual guidance accuracy due to faint markings and flat, diffuse lighting under cloudy noon conditions.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Support safe vehicle handling and consistent surface condition.
Contribution:
- Surface is dry and smooth, with no visible defects or standing water.
- Lacks high visual contrast, which could affect driver perception.
- Surface integrity is acceptable, but not visually optimized for visibility.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Visually communicate lane structure and direction.
Contribution:
- Markings are noticeably faded, especially toward the left side.
- Cloudy lighting reduces contrast between markings and pavement.
- No visible reflectivity or tactile marking enhancements.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Provide visual tracking and automation support.
Contribution:
- Lane-keeping and assistive systems may lose confidence in boundary detection.
- Vision sensors may return uncertain or null lane information.
- Automated features dependent on markings may operate intermittently.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Ensure infrastructure supports all-weather visibility and safety.
Contribution:
- Lane markings appear worn, lacking maintenance for visual resilience.
- No apparent mitigation for cloudy or low-contrast lighting conditions.
- No supplementary visual cues to aid perception (e.g., reflectors or cat's eyes).

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Interpret markings and maintain proper vehicle alignment.
Contribution:
- Flat lighting and weak markings reduce lane distinction.
- Visual ambiguity may lead to hesitation or unintended drift.
- Drivers must exert greater effort to compensate for missing cues.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Alert drivers to reduced visibility or related risks.
Contribution:
- No dynamic signage or alerts related to visual degradation.
- Lack of system feedback for lighting-related driving challenges.
- No behavior-adaptive warnings evident.

Summary:
Although road conditions are physically safe, the combination of faded markings and soft, cloudy lighting produces a low-contrast environment. This impairs both driver and vehicle subsystem perception, increasing the risk of subtle misalignment or guidance failures.
