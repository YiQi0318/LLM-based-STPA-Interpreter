CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Risk of delayed reaction or lane deviation due to poor marking visibility and flat ambient lighting under cloudy midday conditions.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide safe and uniform driving platform.
Contribution:
- Surface appears dry and intact with no visible damage or debris.
- Texture is consistent but low in contrast.
- No drainage issues, though surface lacks visual variation.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Define lanes and guide driver/system navigation.
Contribution:
- Lane markings are faded and difficult to discern under diffuse light.
- No reflective or contrast-enhancing materials visible.
- Markings not optimized for low-angle sunlight or overcast conditions.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Enable lane tracking, stability, and driver assistance.
Contribution:
- Visual lane-following systems may lose confidence or disengage.
- Lane centering and departure warnings may be unreliable.
- Overall reduction in environmental perception accuracy.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Ensure visual clarity and structural readiness.
Contribution:
- No signs of recent repainting or visual upgrade of markings.
- No adaptive infrastructure present to enhance visual guidance under changing light.
- System does not appear responsive to visibility needs.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Interpret visual cues and operate vehicle safely.
Contribution:
- May misjudge lane position due to faded markings and flat lighting.
- Increased reliance on memory or estimation of lane edges.
- Cognitive strain may elevate error potential in lane transitions.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Communicate condition-based driving risks.
Contribution:
- No alerts or dynamic signage addressing limited visibility.
- No context-aware driver notification observed.
- System does not compensate for ambiguous visual environments.

Summary:
Although physical conditions are dry and unobstructed, visual cues are weak due to low-contrast markings and ambient cloudy light. These factors challenge both human perception and automated systems, creating moderate navigation uncertainty in an otherwise structurally safe environment.
