CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Elevated risk of vehicle-bicycle collision due to lack of structural separation, visual clutter, and unpredictable trajectory in a shared-use urban setting.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Support safe and stable operation for all road users.
Contribution:
- Surface is clear and dry, with no visible defects or obstructions.
- No surface treatment or demarcation to guide or protect cyclists.
- Visual continuity of the road blends vehicle and cyclist space without distinction.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Inform road users of right-of-way, space allocation, and behavior.
Contribution:
- Only a centerline is visible; no bicycle lane or lateral guidance markings.
- No signs indicating cyclist presence or reduced speed zone.
- Absence of turn or yield indicators at upcoming junctions.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Provide detection, prediction, and guidance assistance.
Contribution:
- Cyclist tracking must rely entirely on visual systems without road context.
- Vehicle in left lane partially obstructs the field of view, introducing occlusion risk.
- Predictive algorithms may struggle to determine cyclist intent or lane positioning.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Design and maintain infrastructure for multimodal safety.
Contribution:
- No structural or visual separation for bicycles.
- No traffic calming, signage, or crossing infrastructure in proximity to the cyclist.
- Layout does not promote cyclist safety despite high interaction probability.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Maintain awareness of dynamic road users and plan accordingly.
Contribution:
- Vehicle turning or overtaking behavior may endanger the cyclist due to lack of defined space.
- Visual load from urban background (fencing, shadows, trees) complicates hazard recognition.
- Drivers may underestimate cyclist speed or path deviation without explicit cues.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Offer hazard alerts or speed moderation support.
Contribution:
- Clear weather and visibility, but environment lacks smart infrastructure or alerts.
- No electronic signage or dynamic risk indicators to aid situational awareness.
- System is entirely passive and unresponsive to road-user diversity.

Summary:
This image depicts a moderate-risk environment for bicycle navigation. The shared road space, lack of visual guidance, and urban occlusion sources introduce hazards for both cyclists and drivers. Automated and human decision-making is burdened by ambiguity, increasing the likelihood of delayed response or unsafe lane sharing.
