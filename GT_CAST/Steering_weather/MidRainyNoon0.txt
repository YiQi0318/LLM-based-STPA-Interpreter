CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Increased potential for lane misalignment or reduced control accuracy due to moderate rain, wet pavement, and low-contrast markings.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Ensure safe vehicle operation during varied weather.
Contribution:
- Surface is wet, with some visible streaks from moderate rain.
- Slightly uneven texture and water dispersion suggest suboptimal drainage.
- Risk of traction loss if conditions worsen.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Provide essential lane and navigation guidance.
Contribution:
- Lane lines are faded and partially obscured by wet sheen.
- Rain and glare further reduce marking visibility.
- No reflective or rain-resistant line treatments detected.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Maintain control and situational awareness.
Contribution:
- Lane-keeping and visual guidance systems may lose reliability.
- Braking and stability controls may respond inconsistently under wet friction conditions.
- Sensor interpretation is challenged by low visual contrast and wet surfaces.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Oversee infrastructure maintenance and driver support systems.
Contribution:
- No visual or electronic alerts about wet road conditions.
- Faded markings suggest deferred repainting or inspection schedules.
- No temporary safety measures deployed during rain.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Monitor and adapt to driving conditions.
Contribution:
- Difficulty detecting lane boundaries accurately in current visibility.
- Potential for delayed or incorrect steering input.
- Increased stress and reliance on degraded environmental cues.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Provide timely risk communication.
Contribution:
- No real-time signage or rain-condition alerts observed.
- System does not appear to inform drivers about current road slipperiness.
- Lacks integration between rain events and driver behavior support.

Summary:
This situation represents a moderate weather hazard scenario, where fading lane markings and rain-induced visibility degradation pose a safety concern. Both human and machine guidance systems face interpretation challenges, raising the risk of lane deviation or delayed response without adequate mitigation.
