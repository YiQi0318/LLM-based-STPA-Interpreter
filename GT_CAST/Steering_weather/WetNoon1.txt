CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Increased risk of vehicle deviation or crash due to inconsistent lane markings and surface water on a wet road.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Base infrastructure supporting vehicle movement.
Contribution:
- Water patches indicate poor surface drainage.
- Slight surface discoloration or wear may reduce traction.
- Maintenance does not appear to resolve pooling or surface wear.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Guide vehicles and define lane structure.
Contribution:
- Lane markings are inconsistently spaced and partially faded.
- Visual lane separation is unclear in some areas.
- No supplemental visual aids such as reflectors or colored lines.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Hardware/software control systems under dynamic conditions.
Contribution:
- Risk of hydroplaning on wet patches with low-quality tires.
- Lane-keeping systems may malfunction due to unclear markings.
- Driver assistance technologies depend on clear lane visibility.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Authority for infrastructure upkeep and public safety.
Contribution:
- Failure to address line repainting and drainage improvement.
- Absence of signage for temporary hazards or wet road warnings.
- Preventive maintenance strategies appear underutilized.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Manual control and decision-making under uncertainty.
Contribution:
- May misjudge lane paths due to inconsistent visuals.
- Potential overreaction or unsafe lane correction behavior.
- Decisions may be based on incomplete environmental feedback.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Communication of weather-related road risks.
Contribution:
- No visible indicators of wet surface warnings.
- Lack of environmental alerts increases driver exposure to surprise hazards.
- System may not localize warnings effectively for surface-level risks.

Summary:
The observed road condition reveals a system-level safety vulnerability, where poor water management, degraded visual cues, and a lack of environmental feedback contribute to heightened risk. Driver behavior, vehicle capabilities, and missing systemic safeguards all factor into a potentially hazardous scenario.
