CAST Step 3 - Analyze Each Component in the Loss
Assumed Loss: Moderate risk of lane departure or vehicle guidance degradation due to poor lane visibility under cloudy sunset lighting.

Component 1: Road Surface and Maintenance
Role: Provide traction and ensure visual consistency.
Contribution:
- Surface appears dry and in good condition.
- No pooling or major surface defects observed.
- Maintenance is adequate, though visual contrast is low under current lighting.

Component 2: Road Markings and Signage
Role: Offer visual guidance for lane maintenance.
Contribution:
- Lane markings are faint and blend with the pavement in low-angle light.
- No reflective or high-contrast paint used to support varied visibility.
- Markings may be insufficient for safe navigation under dim or diffuse light.

Component 3: Vehicle Subsystems
Role: Perceive lanes and manage control inputs.
Contribution:
- Lane-keeping assistance may underperform due to faint lines.
- Vision-based systems may misread edges or return false negatives.
- Environmental perception confidence may drop in current visual state.

Component 4: Roadway Management Authority
Role: Design and maintain visually and physically safe roadways.
Contribution:
- No evidence of recent marking refresh or visibility enhancements.
- Lane design does not accommodate variable lighting conditions.
- No infrastructure present to support vision under poor contrast.

Component 5: Drivers
Role: Interpret visual feedback and maintain control.
Contribution:
- Visual ambiguity from diffuse light and low contrast increases interpretation time.
- Risk of drifting or hesitation in uncertain lane areas.
- Greater chance of visual fatigue or late corrections.

Component 6: Weather Forecasting / Notification System
Role: Communicate conditions affecting driving performance.
Contribution:
- No visible alerts for low-visibility or lighting concerns.
- System does not appear to support lighting-aware navigation assistance.
- Missed opportunity for behavior adaptation or hazard awareness.

Summary:
Although physical conditions are dry and unobstructed, visual clarity is compromised by low-contrast markings and overcast sunset light. This increases the cognitive and perceptual load on both drivers and automation systems, moderately raising the risk of trajectory error or lane-keeping failure.
